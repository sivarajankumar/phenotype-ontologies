**THIS REPOSITORY HAS BEEN SPLIT INTO MULTIPLE GITHUB REPOS**

For details see:
https://github.com/obophenotype/upheno



The **phenotype-ontologies** repository aggregates OWL ontologies and associated inter-ontology relationships, including [LogicalDefinitions](LogicalDefinitions.md) for [human](HP.md), [mouse](MP.md), [zebrafish](ZP.md), [fly](DPO.md) and [worm](WBPhenotype.md), later to include [fission yeast](FYPO.md) and others.

# Getting Started #

Please see [GettingStarted](GettingStarted.md) for details on how to work with the OWL files

# OWL axiomatization #

The [OWLAxiomatization](OWLAxiomatization.md) page describes how we represent phenotypes in OWL, and how we reason with the resulting structures

# Applications #

The [Applications](Applications.md) page describes how the OWL axiomatization is used in applications such as [OWLSim](http://owlsim.org). This also describes the [CrossSpeciesPhenotypeOntology](CrossSpeciesPhenotypeOntology.md).

# Diseases #

The primary focus of this repository is on phenotypes, which we consider distinct from diseases. However the [DiseaseIntegration](DiseaseIntegration.md) page contains preliminary information on integrating and axiomatization of disease ontologies.

# Traits #

See [TraitsAndPhenotypes](TraitsAndPhenotypes.md).

# Automated builds and QC #

See the [build-pheno-ontologies](http://build.berkeleybop.org/job/build-pheno-ontologies) job on the Berkeley jenkins server

# Getting phenotype data #

Note that this repository is **not** intended to aggregate data - just the ontologies themselves. For the data, please see the respected sources, including:
