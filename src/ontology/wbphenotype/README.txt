Worm Phenotype Equivalence Axioms

See:

 * https://code.google.com/p/phenotype-ontologies/wiki/WBPhenotype

CURRENT WORKFLOW:

Please note We have switched to editing equivalence axioms in Protege
(the OWL will be primary). The core WBPhenotype will remain in obo
with the primary version at WB.

 * Edit wbphenotype-equivalence-axioms-edit.owl
 * Do not edit WPO terms or external ontology terms - equiv axioms only
 * Have Elk turned on the whole time and sync repeatedly
 * Check Jenkins after commit
