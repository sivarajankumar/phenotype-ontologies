This can be the result of maldigestion (e.g., pancreatic disease or Coeliac disease), in which the nutrients are left in the lumen to pull in water. Osmotic diarrhea can also be caused by osmotic laxatives (which work to alleviate constipation by drawing water into the bowels). In healthy individuals, too much magnesium or vitamin C or undigested lactose can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel. A person who does not have lactose intolerance can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products.

As such, it is one of the best studied examples of a condition caused by loss of neighbouring (contiguous) genes.

relationship: has_locus UBERON:0005599 ! common dorsal aorta
! Mitral valve stenosis is a rheumatic disease of mitral valve characterized by the narrowing of the orifice of the mitral valve of the heart. Most cases of mitral stenosis are due to disease in the heart secondary to rheumatic fever and the consequent rheumatic heart disease. Less common causes of mitral stenosis are calcification of the mitral valve leaflets, and as a form of congenital heart disease. However, there are primary causes of mitral stenosis that emanate from a cleft mitral valve. Other causes include Bacterial endocarditis where the vegetations may favor increase risk of stenosis.
