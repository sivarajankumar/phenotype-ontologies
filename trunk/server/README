This directory contains configurations necessary to start an OWLSim
server running over the set of ontologies in this repo (src/ontolog/),
together with triples exported from Monarch (data/).

First ensure all directories are up to date. From this directory:

    svn update ../data ../src/ontology

Note that the cache files required by OWLSim are not distributed in
SVN as they are too large. To build them, you will need owltools and
make.

Type:

    make

This will create:

   all.owl <- analysis ontology, including phenotype associations
   ic-cache.owl <- information content values
   owlsim.cache <- lookup table of all class pairs

Now type:

   ./start-owlsim-server

It may take a few minites to start up

Connect on port 9031.

Note the first operation may take a few minutes.

See owlsim docs.
