relationship: has_material_basis SYMP:0019180 ! constipation
! Osmotic diarrhea is a dirrhea where diarrhea occurs when too much water is drawn into the bowels. This can be the result of maldigestion (e.g., pancreatic disease or Coeliac disease), in which the nutrients are left in the lumen to pull in water. Osmotic diarrhea can also be caused by osmotic laxatives (which work to alleviate constipation by drawing water into the bowels). In healthy individuals, too much magnesium or vitamin C or undigested lactose can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel. A person who does not have lactose intolerance can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products.

! A bronchial disease that is a chronic inflammatory condition of one or more bronchi or bronchioles marked by dilatation and loss of elasticity of the walls resulting from damage to the airway wall leading to the formation of small sacs on the bronchial wall and impairment of cilia mobility in the lung. Inflammation of the bronchial wall increases mucus secretion which serves as a breeding ground for bacteria. Bronchiectasis is caused by repeated respiratory infections, immune deficiency disorders, hereditary disorders (cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia), mechanical factors (inhaled object or a lung tumor) or inhaling toxic substances.
