upheno_maker
------------

This tool is for generating the uberpheno ontology. It is designed to
be executed from inside the phenotype-ontologies project.

Pre-Requisites
--------------

The current main pre-requisite is Thea, which itself depends on SWI-Prolog.

SWI-Prolog can be downloaded from:

  http://swi-prolog.org

The latest debian version should be fine, but be sure to include the
jpl extension.

(For OS-X users, installation via the dmg file is easy)

Thea can be downloaded from github. You will need to switch to the pkb branch:

  git clone git://github.com/vangelisv/thea.git
  git co pkb

Then add thea to your path:

  export PATH=$HOME/thea/bin

(assuming you cloned in your top-level)

Running
-------

Use the makefile in ../../src/ontology/uberpheno/
