# OWL Axiomatization #

The OWL axioms for WBPhenotype are in the [src/ontology/wbphenotype](http://phenotype-ontologies.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/ontology/wbphenotype/) directory on this site.

  * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/wbphenotype.owl - direct conversion of WormBase-supplied obo file
  * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/wbphenotype/wbphenotype-importer.owl - imports additional axioms.

The structure roughly follows that of the [MP](MP.md). The worm anatomy is used.


# Editing the axioms #

Currently the source is wbphenotype/wbphenotype-equivalence-axioms.obo, the OWL is generated from here. We are considering switching this around, so the OWL is edited, using Protege.
