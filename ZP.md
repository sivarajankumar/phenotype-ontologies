# Introduction #

This page describes the generation of the zebrafish phenotype ontology

# Details #

The ZP differs considerably from [HP](HP.md), [MP](MP.md) and others. ZFIN do not annotate with a pre-composed phenotype ontology - all annotations compose phenotypes on-the-fly using a combination of PATO, ZFA, GO and other ontologies.

We use these combinations to construct ZP on the fly, by naming each distinct combination, assigning it an ID, and placing it in the hierarchy.

The process is described here:

The OWL formalism for ZFIN annotations is described here:

# OWL Axiomatization #

The OWL axioms for ZP are in the [src/ontology/zp](http://phenotype-ontologies.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/ontology/zp/) directory on this site.

Because ZP is built "pre-axiomatized", the equivalence axioms are already present in zp.owl

  * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/zp/zp-importer.owl - brings in other ontologies
