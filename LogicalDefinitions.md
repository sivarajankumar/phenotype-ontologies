# Introduction #

"Logical Definitions" is the term we use for definitions expressed in a logic language such as OWL. For phenotype ontologies, logical definitions connect phenotypes to classes in multiple [OBO library](http://obofoundry.org) ontologies.

Logical definitions are expressed using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). For historic reasons, some of these logical definitions are authored in OBO-Format, which is a restricted subset of OWL.
