# Imported ontologies

= Introduction =

Imports directory:

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/upheno/imports/

Currently the imports includes:

 * imports/chebi_import.owl
 * imports/doid_import.owl
 * imports/go_import.owl
 * imports/mpath_import.owl
 * imports/pato_import.owl
 * imports/pr_import.owl
 * imports/uberon_import.owl
 * imports/wbbt_import.owl

= Anatomy =

To avoid multiple duplicate classes for heart, lung, skin etc we map all classes to [Uberon] where this is applicable. For more divergent species such as fly and C elegans we use the appropriate species-specific ontology.

Currently there are a small number of highly specific classes in FMA that are being used and have no corresponding class in Uberon

= Methods =

We use the OWLAPI SyntacticLocalityModularityExtractor, via [OWLTools]. See the http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/upheno/Makefile for details
