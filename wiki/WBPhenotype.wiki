= OWL Axiomatization =

The OWL axioms for WBPhenotype are in the [http://phenotype-ontologies.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/ontology/wbphenotype/ src/ontology/wbphenotype] directory on this site.

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/wbphenotype.owl - direct conversion of WormBase-supplied obo file
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/wbphenotype/wbphenotype-importer.owl - imports additional axioms.

The structure roughly follows that of the [MP]. The worm anatomy is used.
 
 
= Editing the axioms =

Currently the source is wbphenotype/wbphenotype-equivalence-axioms.obo, the OWL is generated from here. We are considering switching this around, so the OWL is edited, using Protege.
