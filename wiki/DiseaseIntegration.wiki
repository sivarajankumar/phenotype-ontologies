#summary Disease Integration

= Introduction =

Our primary focus here is on axiomatization of phenotypes.

Associations between diseases and phenotypes have been curated by Peter Robinson's group at Charite and by the [PATO] project team members. They are available from [PhenotypeCommons] and the [http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org HPO] website

This project does consist of some preliminary work on axiomatizing diseases and integrating different disease resources.

See the Monarch Initiative [https://github.com/monarch-initiative/disease-miner disease-miner] repo on github to see the code for building the merged disease ontology

We use the OBO disease ontology (DOID) together with OMIM

The merged ontology is available from:

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/upheno/doid/merged.owl
