#summary Competency questions to test a schema/pattern for modeling phenotypes

<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= Introduction =

This is background material for discussion amongst OWL modelers concerning the consequences of modeling choices.

Each competency question is stated in terms of an OWL axiom or axioms that should be entailed, given the existence of supporting axioms in external ontologies. This could be translated into a test suite (e.g. using junit) to objectively test a given model.

examples are given in Manchester syntax. We assume prefixes of the form

{{{
Prefix: MP <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MP_>
}}}

Together with imports of relevant ontologies.

== Core Competency Questions ==

The model *must* be able to derive the desired entailments here.

=== Basic Inheritance using E class hierarchy ===

Example:
{{{
Class: MP:0000550 ## abnormal forelimb morphology
SubClassOf: MP:0002109 ## abnormal limb morphology
}}}

=== Basic Inheritance using Q class hierarchy ===

Example:

{{{
Class: MP:0008153 ## decreased diameter of fibula
SubClassOf: MP:0002187 ## abnormal fibula morphology
}}}

Supporting axioms:
{{{
   is_a PATO:0000051 ! morphology
    is_a PATO:0000117 ! size
     is_a PATO:0000587 ! decreased size
      is_a PATO:0000574 ! decreased length
       is_a PATO:0001715 ! decreased diameter
}}}

And:

{{{
Class: PATO:0001715 ## decreased diameter
EquivalentTo: PATO:0001334  ## diameter
  and decreased_in_magnitude_relative_to some PATO:0000461 ## normal
}}}


=== Basic Inheritance using E partonomy ===

Example:
{{{
Class: MP:0002110 ## abnormal digit morphology
SubClassOf: MP:0000572 ## abnormal autopod morphology
}}}

Existing approaches:

The approach described in [http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/1/R2/#sec2 Mungall et al 2010] uses a new relation:

{{{
ObjectPorperty: inheres_in_part_of
SubPropertyChain: inheres_in o part_of
ObjectProperty: inheres_in SubPropertyOf: inheres_in_part_of
}}}

Then, assuming a basic Q-in-E model, we can write:

{{{
Class: MP:0002110 ## abnormal digit morphology
EquivalentTo: morphology and inheres_in_part_of some digit and qualifier abnormal
Class: MP:0000572 ## abnormal autopod morphology
EquivalentTo: morphology and inheres_in_part_of some digit and qualifier abnormal
}}}

To obtain the desired inference (also works if the digit morphology term is restricted to inheres_in).

Informally, we can think of this in terms of a weaker relation that permits propagation up the E partonomy (and subclass), and a stronger relation that only propagates up subclass.

The main challenge here is deciding which qualities should be propagated when. An abnormal morphology of a nucleus of a muscle cell of digit 1 would satisfy the condition, but this would be an undesirable inference. To recapitulate the desired level of propagation will require a more sophisticated approach.

== Advanced Competency Questions ==

Some of these may simply be too hard. Others may be controversial w.r.t what the intended meaning of the phenotype is, and what the expected entailment is.
