This page describes the generation of the zebrafish phenotype ontology

= Details =

The ZP differs considerably from [HP], [MP] and others. ZFIN do not annotate with a pre-composed phenotype ontology - all annotations compose phenotypes on-the-fly using a combination of PATO, ZFA, GO and other ontologies.

We use these combinations to construct ZP on the fly, by naming each distinct combination, assigning it an ID, and placing it in the hierarchy.

The process is described here:
