#summary Getting started with OWL phenotype axioms

= Introduction =

This page describes how to get started with the OWL axioms


= Details =

Unfortunately the full OWL axiomatization is not yet visible in OntoBee, the best way to view these is to look at them in Protege 4.

You can open any of the PURLs directly in Protege. For example

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mp/mp-importer.owl
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp/hp-importer.owl

Loading over the web can be slow, so you may want to check files out locally. Click on the link "source" above to see how to check out the repo using SVN. Once checked out, you should have a directory structure:

 * src
  * ontology
   * mp
   * hp
   * ...
