The cross-species phenotype ontologies is constructed using

 * [HP]
 * [MP]
 * [ZP]

And associated OWL axioms. Classes inferred to be equivalent are merged.

Note that it is also possible to load individual sets by grouping taxon:

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/upheno/mammal.owl ([MP] plus [HP])
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/upheno/vertebrate.owl (above plus [ZP])
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/upheno/metazoa.owl (above plus [WBPhenotype]) - todo: add [DPO]
 * TODO - eukartote, all
