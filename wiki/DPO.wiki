#summary Drosophila Phenotype Ontology

 * [http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/4/1/30/abstract The Drosophila phenotype ontology] Osumi-Sutherland et al, J Biomed Sem.

The DPO is formally a subset of FBcv, made available from http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/fbcv/dpo.owl

Phenotypes in FlyBase may either by assigned to FBcv (dpo) classes, or they may have a phenotype_manifest_in to FBbt (anatomy).

For integration we generate the following ontologies:

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/upheno/imports/fbbt_phenotype.owl
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/upheno/imports/uberon_phenotype.owl
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/upheno/imports/go_phenotype.owl
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/upheno/imports/cl_phenotype.owl

(see Makefile)

This includes a phenotype class for every anatomy class - the IRI is suffixed with "PHENOTYPE". Using these ontologies, Uberon and CL phenotypes make the groupings.

We include

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/upheno/dpo/dpo-importer.owl

Which imports dpo plus auto-generated fbbt phenotypes.

The dpo-importer is included in the [MetazoanImporter]

== Additional Notes ==

We create a local copy of fbbt that has "Drosophila " prefixed to all labels. This gives us a hierarchy:

 * neuron phenotype
  * drosophila neuron phenotype

== TODO ==

 * http://code.google.com/p/cell-ontology/issues/detail?id=115 ensure all CL to FBbt equiv axioms are present (we have good coverage for Uberon)
